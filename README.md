# Bayesian Modeling on Recipe and Customer Review Data
## Problem discription
This project is to use Bayesian Machine Learning to build predictive models on recipes and customer reviews datasets. By predicting fundamental recipe properties, such as calories and cooking time, and understanding usersâ€™ behavior and preferences, this project generates insights of restuarants' performance and knowledge to encourage healthy dietary choices. 
We aimed to answer three specific questions:  
1. Classify customer reviews to two categories (high or low), based on minutes to cook, number of steps, number of ingredients, calories and six nutrition facts (total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated_fat, carbohydrates) of a recipe. 
2. Predict calories of a recipe, using these six nutrition facts. 
3. Predict how many minutes a recipe takes to prepare, using the number of steps, number of ingredients, calories and six nutrition facts.
