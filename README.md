# Bayesian Modeling on Recipe and Customer Review Data
This project is to use Bayesian Machine Learning to build predictive models on recipes and customer reviews datasets. Such insights could predict fundamental recipe properties, such as calories and cooking time, and understand usersâ€™ behavior and preferences. This knowledge could be used to encourage healthy dietary choices. 
We aimed to answer three specific questions:  
1. Classify customer reviews to two categories (high or low), based on minutes to cook, number of steps, number of ingredients, calories and six nutrition facts (total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated_fat, carbohydrates) of a recipe. 
2. Predict calories of a recipe, using these six nutrition facts. 
3. Predict how many minutes a recipe takes to prepare, using the number of steps, number of ingredients, calories and six nutrition facts.
